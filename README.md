# Linux-Essentials

"Linux Essentials" are a combination of custom scripts I install on every Ubuntu Box that make my experience a little easier, along with frequently used package installs. To add more package add to "requirements.txt" prior to install.

## Installation
Make "install_v.xx.sh executable.
```bash
sudo chmod +x install_v.01.sh
```
Use if "root" user.
```bash
chmod +x install_v.01.sh
```
Execute the install command:
```bash
sudo ./install_v.01.sh
```
"root" user
```bash
sudo ./install_v.01.sh
```
## Usage
"Search" command is a small script that helps find directories and file with the exact name. 
Type "search" then [ENTER],
```bash
sudo search 
```
output
```bash
What are you looking for?
```
or
```bash
sudo search <keyword>
```
Now note, this will search the entrie file system.
